				I am a developer and reverse engineer from Estonia. I don't just use software; I deconstruct it to understand and bypass its limitations. My work is a practical application of low-level systems knowledge to solve complex problems in automation and security.
			</p>
			<p>
				A perfect example is my <strong>PixelPlaceJS</strong> project. The site owner allows botting but intentionally makes it difficult as a technical challenge. To solve this, I had to dive into layers of heavily obfuscated JavaScript to reverse engineer their WebSocket protocol. This wasn't just about reading network traffic; it was about finding the clever tricks hidden in their code to bypass custom rate-limiting and client-side security checks, ultimately allowing me to build a lightweight, headless client that speaks the native language of the server.
			</p>
			<p>
				I apply this same methodology everywhere: from injecting DLLs to patch memory in compiled applications like <strong>GeforceNowAMD</strong>, to understanding the digital fingerprints (TLS, Canvas) that power modern anti-bot systems. I have extensive experience bypassing advanced fraud detection by manipulating these signals.
			</p>
			<p>
				This site is a portfolio of that work. On my <a href="/blog">Blog</a>, I post writeups detailing the thought process and technical execution behind these projects. For a complete overview, see the <a href="/about">About</a> page or dive into the code on <a href="https://github.com/ShufflePerson">GitHub</a>.
