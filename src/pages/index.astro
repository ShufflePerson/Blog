			<h1>🧑‍💻 Shuffleperson</h1>
			<p>
				I am a developer and reverse engineer based in Estonia. My work focuses on dissecting software to make it do things it wasn't designed to do.
			</p>
			<p>
				I specialize in <strong>Binary and Web Reverse Engineering</strong>, <strong>Game Automation</strong>, and <strong>Fingerprinting Evasion</strong>. I don't just use tools; I build the logic that bypasses restrictions, patches memory, and automates interactions at a low level.
			</p>
			<p>
				From injecting DLLs into cloud gaming services to writing custom deobfuscators for malicious scripts, my projects demonstrate a deep understanding of how systems break.
