	<p>
		I am a developer based in Estonia focused on reverse engineering, internal API analysis, and automation. My background covers both low-level Windows internals and high-level web protocols.
	</p>

	<h3>Binary Analysis & Injection</h3>
	<p>
		My work often involves memory manipulation and function hooking to modify software behavior.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>GeforceNowAMD:</strong> A DLL injection patch for the Geforce Now client. It hooks internal functions to bypass hardware checks, enabling 240fps streaming on restricted AMD GPUs.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Vulnerability Research:</strong> Experience finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in cloud gaming services to execute arbitrary code.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Deobfuscation & Web Protocols</h3>
	<p>
		I build tools to analyze and interact with protected systems, focusing on stripping away obfuscation layers.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>De4Lua:</strong> A deobfuscator for Lua scripts, designed to analyze protected logic in game modifications.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>PixelPlaceJS / Defly.io:</strong> Reverse-engineered wrappers for game APIs. These projects bypass the UI layer entirely to interact directly with game servers via WebSockets and HTTP requests.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Fingerprinting Evasion</h3>
	<p>
		I have extensive experience with browser fingerprinting (TLS, Canvas, AudioContext) and fraud detection systems. My research focuses on manipulating these signals to maintain low risk-scores, utilizing anti-detect browsers and residential proxies to emulate legitimate user identities.
	</p>

	<h3>Performance Automation</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>AimAhead:</strong> A low-level AI implementation focused on high-performance object detection. The project prioritizes execution speed and efficiency over standard machine learning overhead.
